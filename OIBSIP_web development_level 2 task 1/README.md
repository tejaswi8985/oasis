## Task 1 – Web Calculator

This is a simple and fully functional web-based calculator developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship (Level 2 – Task 1). The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Along with these, it also includes extra features like percentage (%), square root (√), brackets (), and an "Ans" button to recall the previous result.

The calculator features a clean and interactive user interface, and the layout is fully responsive thanks to modern CSS Grid. It works smoothly on all screen sizes and devices. JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and perform real-time calculations.

This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, especially in DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and UI logic.
