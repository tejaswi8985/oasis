## Task 3 – To-Do Web Application

This project is a simple and responsive To-Do Web Application developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship (Level 2 – Task 3). Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. Users can instantly add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks to maintain a clean and organized list. The user interface is clean and interactive, offering a smooth experience across different devices.

This task helped me improve my skills in front-end logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design while working on a real-world task management solution.
