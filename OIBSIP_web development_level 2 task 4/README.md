## Task 4 – Login Authentication System

This project is a clean and functional Login Authentication System developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship (Level 2 – Task 4). It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes essential features such as user registration, login, and access control. Users can securely sign up and log in, with front-end validations ensuring clean and valid inputs. Upon successful login, users are granted access to a protected page, simulating real-world client-side authentication.

This project helped enhance my understanding of form handling, front-end logic, validation, and access flow in web applications.
